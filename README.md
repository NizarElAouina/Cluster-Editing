# Cluster-Editing
The cluster editing problem, is a decision problem that, for a graph G chooses the most likely subgraphs to form a clique. Then it creates disconnected cliques.

So this is an implementation of a new heuristic approach for cluster editing. <br>
If you want to understand the algorithm, read the Cluster Editing Markdown.ipynb file. <br>
The functions are available in the FunctionsCluster.py<br>
The main file is where the algorithm is executed.<br>
The graph.gr file is an example of the input file.<br>
Finally, here is an example of a graph : <br><br>

And after the execution of the algorithm :<br><br>
